In General, I am  interested in understanding mechanisms and processes causing biological patterns and how they change across different organismal, spatial and temporal scales;  organizmal (from an individual cell to meta-ecosystem), spatial (local to global), and temporal (eco,evo,devo). 

**Ongoing:**
> how the nature of species local interactions combined with regional environmentally forced dispersal shape the growth, stability and persistence of metapopulations?
>


**Methods:**

I use mathematical models, computer simulations and statistical analyses of large datasets (e.g. biophysical data).
