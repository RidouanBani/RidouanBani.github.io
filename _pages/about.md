I am theoretical ecologist and mathematical biologist. My overarching research interests revolve around understanding the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms and processes behind biological diversity and how they change across different organismal organization (e.g. from an individual cell to an ecosystem level) and spatial (e.g. local to global) during {eco-evo} temporal scales. What are the roles of dispersal, interactions (e.g. parasitism, intra/inter-competition, predation), fitness (e.g. demographic, functional, behavioral) and its plasticity (inter-individual variability), density regulation, and environmental conditions variability (spatial and temporal)? 

I deploy a variety of mathematical, statistical, and computational tools and technics to model complex natural systems into quasi-realistic and interpretable level that allows advancement of our understanding about system dynamics, functionality, and evolvability.

I enjoy applying theory  to specific systems with available data.
