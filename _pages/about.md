I am an applied mathematician, ecologist, and data scientist, my research interests focus on understanding complex natural systems and associated processes that drive them, as well as how these processes change across different spatial and temporal scales. My previous projects have involved studying species interactions, as well as the relationship between biological traits of marine species and their physical environments. Additionally, I have also worked on modeling substance abuse (including alcohol and methamphetamine) and tropical vector-borne diseases such as Lymphatic filariasis and Leishmania. In the future, I aim to continue using mathematical and statistical models, big data, and machine learning to gain a deeper understand of natural systems dynamics and develop strategies for their sustainable management and conservation.
