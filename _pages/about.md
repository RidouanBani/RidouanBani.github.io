In General, I am  interested in understanding mechanisms and processes behind biological diversity and how these processes and mechanisms change across different organismal organization (from an individual cell to an ecosystem), spatial (local to global) and temporal (eco/evo/devo) scales. Such mechanisms include  horizontal (with self and other competitor(s)) and vertical (with predator(s) and prey(s)) interactions, fitness (demographycal, functional or behavioral) and its plasticity (inter-individual variability),  environmental conditions and their variability (spatial and temporal), and at last not at least dispersal.


**Tools**

* Literature

* Conceptualization and/or emperical evidense

* Mathematical modeling, Statistical analyses  

* Computer programming


**Ongoing:**
> Metapopulation's fluctuations = Y(dispersal(Moran effect, traits), species interactions)

> Eco-Evo dynamics 

> Marine protected areas networks in a varrying environment: how big and distant?
