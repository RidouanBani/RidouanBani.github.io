**Introduction**



I am theoretical ecologist, mathematical biologist. My overarching research interests revolve around understanding the mechanisms and processes behind biological complex systems, and how these processes and mechanisms changes across different organismal organization (e.g. from an individual to an ecosystem level), spatial (e.g. local to global), and both ecological and evolutionary temporal scales. What are the roles of dispersal, interactions (e.g. parasitism, intra/inter-competition, predation), fitness (e.g. demographic, functional, behavioral) and its plasticity (interindividual variability), density regulation, and environmental conditions variability (spatial and temporal)? To answer these questions, I deploy a variety of mathematical, statistical, and computational tools and technics to model complex natural systems into quasi-realistic and interpretable level that allows advancement of our understanding about system dynamics, functionality, and evolvability.
I combine theory with applications to specific systems with available data whenever possible.




**Ongoing:**
> [Metapopulations dynamics, populations fluctuations, and stochastic dispersal ](https://ridouanbani.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/)

Ecological dynamics can help predict whether a species is prone to extinction or not. Populations  fluctuate, they grow during good times (e.g., many births and/or few deaths) and decrease during bad periods (e.g., few births and/or many  deaths). Four demographic processes are responsible for populations' fluctuations mainly (b)irth, (i)mmigration, (d)eath, and (e)migrattion or the BIDE rates. In genral, I aim to understand the causes and consequences of BIDE rates variations and covariations on populations fluctuations and persistence.

> [Climate change and marine metapopulation: The dispersal mediated effects](https://ridouanbani.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)

With ongoing rapid climate change, marine species with bipartite life cycle; a sedentary adult phase and larval pelagic phase, are subjected to effects that increase adult mortality, modify pelagic features such as larval duration as well as ocean currents. In this project, I considered the indirect effects of both abiotic ocean currents and temperature-prone larval duration to investigate the combined effects of climate change on both local mortality and regional dispersal and how they affect stability of marine metapopulations. 

> [Marine protected areas network in a varrying environment: Where, how big and distant?](https://ridouanbani.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3/)

Traditionally mean field theories are used to study marine protected areas aiming for conservations and fishery purposes. Marine protected areas are selected using size of the areas for local species richness and as a proxy for ecological processes and distance between the protected areas for dispersal ability and as proxy for regional stability. Principles for designing marine protected area networks that address social, economic, and biological criteria are well studied in the scientific literature. However, variability of environmental conditions and climate change  represents a new and challenging issues to marine ecosystems functioning and stability. I revisit the problem of size and spacing in MPAs network using stochastic mathematical models.
