In General, I am  interested in understanding mechanisms and processes behind biological diversity and how these processes change across different organismal (from an individual cell to meta-ecosystem), spatial (local to global) and temporal (eco/evo/devo) scales. Such mechanisms include horizontal (with self and other competitors) and vertical (with predators and preys) coexistence, fitness (demography, function or behavior) and its plasticity (inter-individual variability),  environmental conditions and its variability (spatial and temporal), and at last not at least dispersal.


**What I use**

* Mathematical modeling 

* Computer programming, simulations

* Statistical analyses of large datasets (e.g. biophysical data)


**Ongoing:**
> How  species local interactions combined with regional environmentally forced dispersal shape the growth, stability and persistence of metapopulations?

> What are the effects of climate change on both biotic and abatioc drivers of metapopulations growth, stability and persistence?

> Marine protected areas networks in a varrying environment: how big and distant?
