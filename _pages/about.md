I am theoretical ecologist, mathematical biologist. My overarching research interests revolve around understanding the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms and processes behind biological diversity, and how these processes and mechanisms changes across different organismal organization (e.g. from an individual to an ecosystem level), spatial (e.g. local to global), and both ecological and evolutionary temporal scales. What are the roles of dispersal, interactions (e.g. parasitism, intra/inter-competition, predation), fitness (e.g. demographic, functional, behavioral) and its plasticity (interindividual variability), density regulation, and environmental conditions variability (spatial and temporal)? To answer these questions, I deploy a variety of mathematical, statistical, and computational tools and technics to model complex natural systems into quasi-realistic and interpretable level that allows advancement of our understanding about system dynamics, functionality, and evolvability.
I combine theory with applications to specific systems with available data.
