**Introduction**



I am theoretical ecologist, mathematical biologist. My overarching research interests revolve around understanding the mechanisms and processes behind biological complex systems, and how these processes and mechanisms changes across different organismal organization (e.g. from an individual to an ecosystem level), spatial (e.g. local to global), and both ecological and evolutionary temporal scales. What are the roles of dispersal, interactions (e.g. parasitism, intra/inter-competition, predation), fitness (e.g. demographic, functional, behavioral) and its plasticity (interindividual variability), density regulation, and environmental conditions variability (spatial and temporal)? To answer these questions, I deploy a variety of mathematical, statistical, and computational tools and technics to model complex natural systems into quasi-realistic and interpretable level that allows advancement of our understanding about system dynamics, functionality, and evolvability.

I enjoy combining theory with applications to specific systems whenever possible

> [Populations fluctuations ](https://ridouanbani.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/)

Ecological dynamics can help predict whether a species is prone to extinction or not. Populations  fluctuate, they grow during good times (e.g., many births and/or few deaths) and decrease during bad periods (e.g., few births and/or many  deaths). Four demographic processes are responsible for populations' fluctuations mainly (b)irth, (i)mmigration, (d)eath, and (e)migrattion or the BIDE rates. In genral, I aim to understand the causes and consequences of BIDE rates variations and covariations on populations fluctuations and persistence.
