Biodiversity results from the difference between speciation and extinction rates. New species appear, then persist for a while before disappearing. Some species persist for short periods while others last longer. Mother Earth is changing, paleontological records have shown that in some extreme events the rate of extinction increased, leading to a decline in biodiversity. Therefore, understanding the processes behind speciation and extinction and their interactions is essential to  understanding biodiversity.

* Phase one: Why go extinct? 

In General, I am  interested in understanding mechanisms and processes behind biological diversity and how these processes and mechanisms change across different organismal organization (from an individual cell to an ecosystem), spatial (local to global) and temporal (eco/evo/devo) scales. Such mechanisms include  horizontal (with self and other competitor(s)) and vertical (with predator(s) and prey(s)) interactions, fitness (demographycal, functional or behavioral) and its plasticity (inter-individual variability), density regulation, environmental conditions and their variability (spatial and temporal), and at last not at least dispersal.
