I am theoretical ecologist, mathematical biologist,and data scientist. My overarching research interests revolve around understanding the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms and processes behind biological diversity and how they change across different organismal organization (e.g. from an individual cell to an ecosystem level) and spatial (e.g. local to global) during {eco-evo} temporal scales. What are the roles of dispersal, interactions (e.g. parasitism, intra/inter-competition, predation), fitness (e.g. demographic, functional, behavioral) and its plasticity (inter-individual variability), density regulation, and environmental conditions variability (spatial and temporal)? 

To answer these question, I deploy a variety of mathematical, statistical, and computational tools and technics to model complex natural systems into quasi-realistic and interpretable level that allows advancement of our understanding about system dynamics, functionality, and evolvability.
I enjoy applying theory  to specific systems with available data.


Currently working with Prof. Frederic Guichard (McGill University) and Prof. Marie-Josee Fortin (University of Toronto) 
 exploring the role of community structure and dispersal coupling among different habitats affect (1) the emergence of 
pattern at biogeographic scale and (2) the consequences of these patterns on persistence and stability of coastal populations 
and communities in fragmented habitats resulting for marine reserve networks. My Ph.D thesis aim to disentangle the complex 
interactions between species pelagic traits and physical ocean currents, the different pathways throughout which climate 
change can affect such interactions, and proposes a new framework for marine protected areas robust to varying environmental 
conditions including climate change.
