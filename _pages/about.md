In General, I am  interested in understanding mechanisms and processes causing biological patterns and how they change across different organismal, spatial and temporal scales;  organizmal (from an individual cell to meta-ecosystem), spatial (local to global), and temporal (eco,evo,devo). Biological patterns  including biodiversity, species interactions, fitness ( birth, death, reproductions, traits, genes), populations fluctuations, speciation, and extinction.
