In General, I am  interested in understanding mechanisms and processes causing biological patterns and how they change across different organismal, spatial and temporal scales;  organizmal (from an individual cell to meta-ecosystem), spatial (local to global), and temporal (eco,evo,devo). 

**Ongoing:**
> How the nature of species local interactions combined with regional environmentally forced dispersal shape the growth, stability and persistence of metapopulations?

> What are the effects of climate change on both biotic and abatioc drivers of metapopulations growth, stability and persistence?

> Marine protected areas networks: how big and distant?


**Methods:**

. Mathematical models

. Computer programming, simulations

. Statistical analyses of large datasets (e.g. biophysical data)
