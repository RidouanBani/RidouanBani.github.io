In General, I am an Mathematician/Theoretical Ecologist interested in understanding mechanisms and processes causing biological patterns and how they change across different organismal, spatial and temporal scales;  organizmal (from an individual cell to meta-ecosystem), spatial (from local to global scale), and temporal (dynamical eco-evo). Biological patterns  including biodiversity, nature and kind of species interactions, fitness (examples; birth, death, reproductions), populations fluctuations.


Education
------

**Present** *Ph.D. Candidate, Biology*
McGill Univerity, Montreal, Qc, CANADA


**Dissertation:** Dynamic connectivity: Consequences of climate change and application to marine protected areas.
 
 The aim of my PhD thesis is to understand the implications of stochastic dispersal on marine metapopulations and its applications to marine protected areas. In general, my thesis involves building realistic mathematical models, analytically derive important metrics, using available biophysical big data and high-power computing machine to test, refine then validate with results

During my master program at Northeastern Illinois University where I worked with Prof. Anuj Mubayi (Currently Professor of applied mathematics in the school of human Evolution at Arizona State University), I was involved in multiple projects; the goal of these projects is to explore different mathematical and statistical methods used in the modeling of public health problems.
