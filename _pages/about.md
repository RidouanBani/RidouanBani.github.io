In General, I am  interested in understanding mechanisms and processes behind biological diversity and how these processes change across different organismal (from an individual cell to meta-ecosystem), spatial (local to global) and temporal (eco/evo/devo) scales. Such mechanisms include horizontal (with self and other competitors) and vertical (with predators and preys) coexistence, fitness (demography, function or behavior) and its plasticity (inter-individual variability),  environmental conditions and their variability (spatial and temporal), and at last not at least dispersal.


**Tools**

* Literature

* Conceptualization

* Mathematical modeling, Statistical analyses  

* Computer programming


**Ongoing:**
> How  species local interactions combined with regional environmentally forced dispersal shape the growth and stability of metapopulation?

> How climate change reshape connectivity throughout its combined effects on dispersal biotic-traits and abatioc ocean currents circulations thus metapopualtion stability? 

> Marine protected areas networks in a varrying environment: how big and distant?
