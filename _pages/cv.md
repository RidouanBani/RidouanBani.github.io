Education
======
**Present** *Ph.D. Candidate, Biology*
McGill Univerity, Montreal, Qc, CANADA


**Dissertation:** Dynamic connectivity: Consequences of climate change and application to marine protected areas.
 
 The aim of my PhD thesis is to understand the implications of stochastic dispersal on marine metapopulations and its applications to marine protected areas. In general, my thesis involves building realistic mathematical models, analytically derive important metrics, using available biophysical big data and high-power computing machine to test, refine then validate with results
 
**2013** *M.Sc. Applied Mathematics* NorthEasternIllinois University, Chicago, Illinois, USA

During my master program at Northeastern Illinois University where I worked with Prof. Anuj Mubayi (Currently Professor of applied mathematics in the school of human Evolution at Arizona State University), I was involved in multiple projects; the goal of these projects is to explore different mathematical and statistical methods used in the modeling of public health problems.

**2012** *B.Sc. Interisciplinary Studies & Mathematics* NorthEasternIllinois University, Chicago, Illinois, USA
