Ongoing projects:

Currently working with Prof. Frederic Guichard (McGill University) and Prof. Marie-Josee Fortin (University of Toronto) 
to exploring the role of community structure and dispersal coupling among different habitats affect (1) the emergence of 
pattern at biogeographic scale and (2) the consequences of these patterns on persistence and stability of coastal populations 
and communities in fragmented habitats resulting for marine reserve networks. My Ph.D thesis aim to disentangle the complex 
interactions between species pelagic traits and physical ocean currents, the different pathways throughout which climate 
change can affect such interactions, and proposes a new framework for marine protected areas robust to varying environmental 
conditions including climate change.

Past Projects:

Projects concern modeling and time series analysis of some tropical vector-borne diseases such Lymphatic-filariasis (Wichereria bancrofti) and substance abuse such ahcohol and methamphetamine. In general, modeling of complex epidemiological systems is important as we try to understand the mechanisms that shape our environment and to develop reasonable response strategies
