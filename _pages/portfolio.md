**Ongoing projects**:

I am a postdoctoral Scholar with the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences working in collaboration with Dr. Andre Punt (School of Aqautic and Fishery Scineces) and Dr. Dan Holland (Northwest Fisheries Science Center). I am working on developing bio-economic models of several West Coast Fisheries (Dungeness crab, salmon, albacore tuna, and pink shrimp) to understand 1) how environmental variability travels through, and is dampened or amplified by, linked social and ecological processes in fisheries systems and 2) how more integrated management can be used to increase resilience and human benefits.

Fluctuating connectivity may not be the only mechanism behind populations'fluctuations. 
Three major hypothesis link pattern of population' fluctuations to fluctuating environmental conditions, 
interactions among or/and between species, or/and to dispersal. While, These hypothesis have been studied alone or in pairs in order to understand contribution of each to population’ fluctuations.  I study the effects of varying environmental conditions on dispersal, and how it affects metapopulation dynamics when considering species interactions.

With ongoing climate change, marine species with bipartite life cycle; a sedentary adult phase and larval 
pelagic phase, are subjected to effects that modify pelagic features such as larval duration 
as well as ocean currents. In this project, I considered the indirect effects of both abiotic ocean currents and 
temperature-prone larval duration to investigate the combined effects of climate change on both local mortality and 
regional dispersal and how they affect stability of marine metapopulations.

Principles for designing marine protected area (MPAs) networks that address social, economic, and biological criteria are well studied in the scientific literature. However, variability of environmental conditions and climate change represents a new and challenging issue to marine ecosystems functioning and stability. I revisit the problem of size and spacing in MPAs network using stochastic mathematical frameworks.

Projects concern modeling and time series analysis of some tropical vector-borne diseases such Lymphatic-filariasis (Wichereria bancrofti) and substance abuse such ahcohol and methamphetamine. In general, modeling of complex epidemiological systems is important as we try to understand the mechanisms that shape our environment and to develop reasonable response strategies
