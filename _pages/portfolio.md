**Ongoing projects**:

Currently working with Prof. Frederic Guichard (McGill University) and Prof. Marie-Josee Fortin (University of Toronto) 
 exploring the role of community structure and dispersal coupling among different habitats affect (1) the emergence of 
pattern at biogeographic scale and (2) the consequences of these patterns on persistence and stability of coastal populations 
and communities in fragmented habitats resulting for marine reserve networks. My Ph.D thesis aim to disentangle the complex 
interactions between species pelagic traits and physical ocean currents, the different pathways throughout which climate 
change can affect such interactions, and proposes a new framework for marine protected areas robust to varying environmental 
conditions including climate change.

Fluctuating connectivity may not be the only mechanism behind populations'fluctuations. 
Three major hypothesis link pattern of population's fluctuations to fluctuating environmental conditions, 
interactions among or between species, or/and to dispersal. While, These hypothesis have been studied alone or in pairs in order to understand the mechanisms and contribution of each to populationâ€™s fluctuations. I revisit the paradigm of population's fluctuations using a different prospective, I study the effects of varying environmental conditions on dispersal, and how it affect metapopulation dynamics when considering species interactions.

With ongoing rapid climate change, marine species with bipartite life cycle; a sedentary adult phase and larval 
pelagic phase, are subjected to effects that increase adult mortality, modify pelagic features such as larval duration 
as well as ocean currents. In this project, I considered the indirect effects of both abiotic ocean currents and 
temperature-prone larval duration to investigate the combined effects of climate change on both local mortality and 
regional dispersal and how they affect stability of marine metapopulations.

Principles for designing marine protected area networks that address social, economic, and biological criteria are well studied in the scientific literature. However, variability of environmental conditions and climate change represents a new and challenging issues to marine ecosystems functioning and stability. I revisit the problem of size and spacing in MPAs network using stochastic mathematical models.


**Past Projects**:

Projects concern modeling and time series analysis of some tropical vector-borne diseases such Lymphatic-filariasis (Wichereria bancrofti) and substance abuse such ahcohol and methamphetamine. In general, modeling of complex epidemiological systems is important as we try to understand the mechanisms that shape our environment and to develop reasonable response strategies
