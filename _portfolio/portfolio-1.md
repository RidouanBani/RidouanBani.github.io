title: "Metapopulation's fluctuations"
excerpt: "Many marine benthic species undergo a pelagic larval stage during which larvae are transported by ocean currents over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. The aim is to study how dispersal-related traits such as spawning time and larval duration interact with spatiotemporal connectivity to affect metapopulation growth and stability."

Fluctuating connectivity may not be the only mechanism behind populations'fluctuations. 
Three major hypothesis link pattern of population's fluctuations to fluctuating environmental conditions, 
interactions among or between species, or/and to dispersal. While, These hypothesis have been studied alone or inpairs in order to understand the mechanisms and contribution of each to populationâ€™s fluctuations. I revisit the paradigm of population's fluctuations using a different prospective, I study the effects of varying environmental conditions on dispersal, and how it affect metapopulation dynamics when considering species interactions.
