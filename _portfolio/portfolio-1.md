Fluctuating connectivity may not be the only mechanism behind populations'fluctuations. 
Three major hypothesis link pattern of population's fluctuations to fluctuating environmental conditions, 
interactions among or between species, or/and to dispersal. While, These hypothesis have been studied alone or in pairs in order to understand the mechanisms and contribution of each to populationâ€™s fluctuations. I revisit the paradigm of population's fluctuations using a different prospective, I study the effects of varying environmental conditions on dispersal, and how it affect metapopulation dynamics when considering species interactions.
