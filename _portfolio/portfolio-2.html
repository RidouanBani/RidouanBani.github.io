With ongoing climate rapid change we expect habitats suitability to degrade forcing species to move  to new suitable habitats, 
evolve and adapt to the habitat new configuration, or to go extinct. For marine benthic and some fish species characterized 
with a sedentary adult phase and a pelagic phase, climate change affects both adult phase as well as pelagic phase and ocean 
circulations; climate change can decrease demographical fitness during adults phase and behavioral fitness during pelagic phase
such as reduce larval duration and shift spawning time. Our aim is to understand the combined effects on adults and pelagic
phase on regional stability.
