With ongoing rapid climate change, marine species with bipartite life cycle; a sedentary adult phase and larval 
pelagic phase, are subjected to effects that increase adult mortality, modify pelagic features such as larval duration 
as well as ocean currents. In this project, I considered the indirect effects of both abiotic ocean currents and 
temperature-prone larval duration to investigate the combined effects of climate change on both local mortality and 
regional dispersal and how they affect stability of marine metapopulations.
