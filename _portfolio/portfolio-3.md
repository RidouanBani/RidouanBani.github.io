Principles for designing marine protected area networks that address social, economic, and biological criteria are well studied in the scientific literature. However, variability of environmental conditions and climate change represents a new and challenging issues to marine ecosystems functioning and stability. I revisit the problem of size and spacing in MPAs network using stochastic mathematical models.
