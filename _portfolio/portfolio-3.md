title: "Marine protected areas network in a varrying environment: Where, how big and distant?"
excerpt: "Many marine benthic species undergo a pelagic larval stage during which larvae are transported by ocean currents over a 
broad range of spatial and temporal scales. The aim is to study how dispersal-related traits such as spawning time and larval duration
interact with spatiotemporal connectivity to affect metapopulation stability."

Many marine benthic species undergo a pelagic larval stage during which larvae are transported by ocean currents over a broad range
of spatial and temporal scales. Although metapopulation theory predicts how stochastic dispersal can alter the stability of metapopulations,
little is known about how dispersal-related traits such as spawning time and larval duration interact with spatiotemporal connectivity 
to affect metapopulation stability.
