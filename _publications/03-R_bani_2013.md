Abstract: Chlamydia is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States, and the number of incident cases reported has nearly doubled from 2000 to 2011. One limitation of stateâ€“reported surveillance data is that there is a standard delay of 2 to 3 years. We used data from the CDC Atlas to analyze spatial and demographic trends in the reported incidence of chlamydia from 2000-2011. We estimated incidence i) nationally, ii) for each state, and iii) for each demographic group up to 2013, using separate Poisson regression models. Model performance was assessed by the average absolute relative deviation (AARD) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and the relative relative risks among different demographic groups were determined. A Bayesian framework was used to achieve uncertainty quantification for projections up to 2013. Finally, a hierarchical model combining spatial and demographic components was used to make state-level prediction for each demographic group.
