excerpt: 'The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) publicly provides data via an anonymous FTP server, in XML and json files (Australian Bureau of Meteorology 2017). The files are well structured but knowledge of how to use R and parse them is required to extract the data into a data frame for use in R (R Core Team 2017) or requires external programs and scripting to import the data for use. bomrang provides functionality for automated retrieval and parsing of selected weather data files from BoM.'
