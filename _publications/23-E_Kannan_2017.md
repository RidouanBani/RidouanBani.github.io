title: "Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Rice Production"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017/06/23-E_Kannan_2017
excerpt: 'This chapter analyzes the spatial and temporal patterns of rice production and productivity in India. Of the 20 agroecological zones, five account for more than 60% of the total rice area and these zones unfortunately house a large number of low-productivity districts. Most of these low-productivity districts fall under the rainfed rice ecosystem that seems to lack appropriate production technologies. Average total factor productivity (TFP) growth for rice was estimated at 3.28% from 1991–92 to 2012–13, and much of this growth was contributed by technical change with little improvement in technical efficiency change. Among the states, Punjab registered the highest TFP growth of 5.71%, whereas Assam showed a negative growth rate. With the exception of Andhra Pradesh, all states failed to show technical efficiency gains, meaning higher quantities of rice are produced using a higher quantity of input per hectare. Overall, analysis revealed that technical change was the main driver of TFP growth in rice.'
